    "In the midst of a global pandemic and a nationwide quarantine, we noticed the growing need for accessible goods. This got us thinking: there must be thousands who don't have easy access to their favorite products.",
    "Our quest for an all-in-one kit that can be prepared and enjoyed anywhere began and eventually led to the creation of SAMMEE. We see boba as a catalyst for bringing people together and we wanted this to be accessible to everyone.",
    "All our kits are assembled with high-quality ingredients, boba sourced straight from Taiwan, and easy-to-follow recipes and instructions to ensure the perfect drink every time.",
    "Whether youâ€™re trying boba for the first time or just looking for a DIY activity with some friends, weâ€™re happy to be a part of the process.",
